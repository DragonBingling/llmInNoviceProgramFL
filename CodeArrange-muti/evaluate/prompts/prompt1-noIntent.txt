"You are a skilled AI engineer and algorithm teacher who excels in locating novice program bugs accurately.
Now a student has written a program with bugs that fails to pass all the test cases for the problem.
Please identify the potential bug in the provided code and specify the line number where it occurs.

You need to perform two steps for this task:

1. Identify ten lines in the following code that may contain hidden bug.
2. Rank these lines in descending order of the likelihood of causing the bug."

You should return the results in JSON format which is parseable by json.loads()。
consisting of a single JSON object with one field:“faultLocalization” (an array of JSON objects).
The “faultLocalization” array should contain ten JSON objects,each with two fields: “lineNumber” (indicating the line number of the suspicious code)
and “reason” (explaining why this location is identified as potentially faulty).
Note: The codes in the “faultLocalization” array should be listed in descending order of bug suspicion.
